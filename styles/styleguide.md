# FOAM.CSS style guide

This presents the most commonly used FOAM styles.

The FOAM theme is assuming and sets a dark background:

```
html {
 background-color: $darkGrey;
}
```

Most of the cards and buttons are transparent and wouldn't work with a bright background.

More work is needed. Please see the [KSS reference](https://github.com/kss-node/kss/blob/spec/SPEC.md)
